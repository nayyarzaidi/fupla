# fupla

fupla is a FoUr Pass Learning Algorithm for learning from big data.

The only input parameter is -K, which specify the number of interactions to be explored

Pass 1: It computes the statistics for mutual information and conditional mutual information and learn a structure of Bayesian Network.
Pass 2: KDB Pass 
Pass 3: Selective KDB Pass
Pass 4: SGD Pass (in progress)
